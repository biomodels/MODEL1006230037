# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**A mathematical model of the outer medullary collecting duct of the rat.**   
Weinstein AM. _Am J Physiol Renal Physiol_ 2000 Jul;279(1):F24-45
[10894785](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10894785) ,  
**Abstract:**   
A mathematical model of the outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD) has been
developed, consisting of alpha-intercalated cells and a paracellular pathway,
and which includes Na(+), K(+), Cl(-), HCO(3)(-), CO(2), H(2)CO(3), phosphate,
ammonia, and urea. Proton secretion across the luminal cell membrane is
mediated by both H(+)-ATPase and H-K-ATPase, with fluxes through the
H-K-ATPase given by a previously developed kinetic model (Weinstein AM. Am J
Physiol Renal Physiol 274: F856-F867, 1998). The flux across each ATPase is
substantial, and variation in abundance of either pump can be used to control
OMCD proton secretion. In comparison with the H(+)-ATPase, flux through the
H-K-ATPase is relatively insensitive to changes in lumen pH, so as luminal
acidification proceeds, proton secretion shifts toward this pathway.
Peritubular HCO(3)(-) exit is via a conductive pathway and via the
Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchanger, AE1. To represent AE1, a kinetic model has been
developed based on transport studies obtained at 38 degrees C in red blood
cells. (Gasbjerg PK, Knauf PA, and Brahm J. J Gen Physiol 108: 565-575, 1996;
Knauf PA, Gasbjerg PK, and Brahm J. J Gen Physiol 108: 577-589, 1996). Model
calculations indicate that if all of the chloride entry via AE1 recycles
across a peritubular chloride channel and if this channel is anything other
than highly selective for chloride, then it should conduct a substantial
fraction of the bicarbonate exit. Since both luminal membrane proton pumps are
sensitive to small changes in cytosolic pH, variation in density of either AE1
or peritubular anion conductance can modulate OMCD proton secretory rate. With
respect to the OMCD in situ, available buffer is predicted to be abundant,
including delivered HCO(3)(-) and HPO(4)(2-), as well as peritubular NH(3).
Thus, buffer availability is unlikely to exert a regulatory role in total
proton secretion by this tubule segment.
